# Pre Planner for Agents

Pre Planner for Agents is an intelligent planning front-end designed to convert high-level user intents into detailed, agent-ready plans. By leveraging a large language model (LLM), the system decomposes user queries into actionable sub-tasks and produces structured JSON plans that can be directly executed by an agentic AI platform.

## Features

- **Intent Decomposition:**  
  Interprets high-level user inputs and breaks them down into detailed, actionable steps.

- **LLM-Driven Plan Generation:**  
  Uses a large language model to generate structured plans in JSON format, including essential keys like `input`, `requirements`, `context`, and `tools`.

- **Iterative Refinement:**  
  Allows users to choose from multiple generated plans and refine the chosen plan with further suggestions.

- **Agentic Execution Ready:**  
  Outputs plans that can be directly fed into an agentic AI platform (e.g., using a call like `client.beta.maestro.runs.create_and_poll(...)`).

- **FastAPI-Based API:**  
  Provides RESTful endpoints (`/get_plan` and `/refine_plan`) for easy integration and testing.

## Project Structure

pre-planner-for-agents/
├── main.py                  # FastAPI server with API endpoints
├── together_api.py          # TogetherAI class encapsulating LLM calls
├── README.md                # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt         # Project dependencies
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pre-planner-for-agents.git
   cd pre-planner-for-agents
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set your API key:**

   Ensure that your `TogetherAI` class in `together_api.py` is configured with your LLM provider API key. You may set this via environment variables or directly within the code for testing.

## Usage

### Running the Server

To start the FastAPI server, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The server will be available at [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000).

### API Endpoints

#### `/get_plan` (POST)

- **Description:**  
  Generates two JSON-based plan options based on the provided user intent.

- **Request Body Example:**

  ```json
  {
      "user_intent": "Create a detailed travel itinerary for a 7-day trip to Japan with cultural experiences, local cuisine, and transportation recommendations."
  }
  ```

- **Response Example:**

  ```json
  {
      "plan_option_1": "{...JSON plan 1...}",
      "plan_option_2": "{...JSON plan 2...}"
  }
  ```

#### `/refine_plan` (POST)

- **Description:**  
  Refines a given JSON plan based on a user-provided suggestion.

- **Request Body Example:**

  ```json
  {
      "current_plan": "{...existing JSON plan...}",
      "suggestion": "Include a section for budget-friendly recommendations."
  }
  ```

- **Response Example:**

  ```json
  {
      "updated_plan": "{...updated JSON plan...}"
  }
  ```

### Testing the Endpoints

You can test the endpoints using `curl`, Postman, or any other HTTP client. For example:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/get_plan" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_intent": "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris, focusing on art museums and local cuisine."}'
```

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**  
   The user provides a high-level intent (e.g., travel itinerary or claim settlement assistance).

2. **LLM Planning:**  
   The system uses the `TogetherAI` class to send a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM, generating a structured plan in JSON.

3. **Multiple Plan Options:**  
   Two different plan options are generated (using varying temperature parameters) to give the user a choice.

4. **User Refinement:**  
   The user can pick a plan and provide further suggestions, which are used to refine the plan iteratively.

5. **Agentic Execution:**  
   The final JSON plan is structured so that it can be directly passed to an agentic AI platform for execution.
